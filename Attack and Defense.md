* **(2013)** Just-In-Time Code Reuse: On the Effectiveness of Fine-Grained Address Space Layout Randomization
> Since the memory address randomization be well-accepted, multiple memory disclosures has been necessary to craft a ROP attack. Based on this observation, the paper programms adversary routines just-in-time to replace the hard code wrote by experienced attackers， which shatters the illusion of fine-grained randomization migitation defences.
